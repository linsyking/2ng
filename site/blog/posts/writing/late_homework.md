This was an interesting question I though of when I was getting huge (1 pts) deduction for my late homework. I finished my homework before due but forgot to submit. I was thinking that whether it is possible to prove that I finished my homework before due.

There is a trivial and working solution:

:::details A simple solution
We can create a GitHub **public** repository and upload the encrypted homework before due. Later when we want to verify, we can show the secret to others and easily recover the original homework. As long as you trust GitHub and the encryption algorithm, you should believe that the homework is done before due.

You may also replace GitHub with any big social media, like Twitter or Instagram.

In this example, Github acts as an *authority* that both students and teachers trust.

However, there are some problems:

- What if I don't want others know that I was publishing those documents? I want to do this **anonymously**!
- What if I don't want any form of my documents being stored on the server? (including hash)

## Problem Description

Here is the problem:

::::info Problem Description
**The Late Homework Problem.** John is a student (*Prover*) and Peter is John's teacher (*Verifier*). Peter has many students and John is only one of them. Peter released some homework but he needed to leave campus for a while so he cannot grade students' homework. Peter wants his students to finish homework before due (during his leave) and when he came back, all students can prove to Peter that they finished their homework before due. However, there are some restrictions regarding how students can prove their homework finishing time:

- Homework is individual, no communication is allowed between students
- Students cannot communicate with Peter during his leave

John soon realized that it was impossible to prove without an external authority. He discussed with Peter and Peter allowed students to use an Internet authority. However, the authority must follow some rules:

- Students **cannot** send **anything** to the authority, except some `GET` requests anonymously. The get requests headers cannot contain any information except a session id the server returns
- The server (authority) HTTP session policy: generate a unique session id to every time the user requests, and expire it in a few minutes (e.g. 5 minutes)
- When the server expires a session, all data generated by this session will be deleted
- In any session, a user cannot send requests more than $C$ times ($C$ is a pre-decided small constant, e.g. 3, this is used to prevent you from encoding message into binary)
- When sending the request, the authority can respond **any data** (e.g. return a program that can be run on student's computer)
- Peter can only communicate with the authority after he came back
- There might be other people accessing the authority

Assume that we can design the authority server and give it to Peter. How can we design it so that John can proves he did his homework before due and Peter can verify his statement?
