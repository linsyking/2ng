# Personal 2-ng blog

A second personal novel/game blog.

---

I'm trying to migrate docs from old blogs to this new blog.

This new SSG is much faster.

## Build Dependency

`Javascript` is slow, but currently the markdown parsing pipeline has special dependencies on it.

I may want to replace it with a faster parser in the future.

- NodeJS (`markdown-it`): run `pnpm i` after clone
- [soupault](https://soupault.app/)
- highlight
- rust
- convert (imagemagick)
